## **Explanation:**

A **binary search tree (BST)** is a type of binary tree where:

1. Each node has at most two children.
2. For any given node:
    - The **left child** contains a value **less than** the value of the node.
    - The **right child** contains a value **greater than** the value of the node.
3. This property applies recursively to all nodes in the tree.

### Overview of other options:

- **a)** The right child of the node containing the element 15 is contains an element that is lesser than its parent which violates the rules of a BST.
- **c)** The right child of the node containing the element 16 is contains an element that is lesser than its parent which violates the rules of a BST.
- **d)** The right child of the node containing the element 20 is contains an element that is lesser than its parent which violates the rules of a BST.
