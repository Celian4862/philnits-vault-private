Which of the following is an appropriate description of a botnet?

**a) A collection of internet-connected devices, including IoT devices, infected and controlled by a common type of malware**

**b) A scalable and reliable network of self-driving vehicles communicating with each other to avoid accidents/collisions**

**c) A set of honeypots designed to detect and analyze malicious activities by hackers to secure the production systems in the future**

**d) A wireless network for industrial robots created for collaborative manufacturing in a factory to ensure quality at all levels**
?
**a) A collection of internet-connected devices, including IoT devices, infected and controlled by a common type of malware**
## **Explanation:**

A **botnet** refers to a network of compromised computers and devices that are controlled remotely by an attacker. These devices, often referred to as "bots" or "zombies," can include a variety of internet-connected devices, including personal computers, servers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Botnets are typically used to perform various malicious activities, such as launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, stealing personal information, or sending spam.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **b) A scalable and reliable network of self-driving vehicles communicating with each other to avoid accidents/collisions**: This describes a network of autonomous vehicles, not a botnet.
- **c) A set of honeypots designed to detect and analyze malicious activities by hackers to secure the production systems in the future**: Honeypots are decoy systems used to attract and analyze attacks, which is different from a botnet.
- **d) A wireless network for industrial robots created for collaborative manufacturing in a factory to ensure quality at all levels**: This describes a specific application of robotics and IoT in manufacturing, not a botnet.

Therefore, the most appropriate description of a botnet is **a)**.
