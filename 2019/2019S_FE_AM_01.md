For an eight-bit integer x represented in twoâ€™s complement format, which of the following yields the value of 5x? Here, the overflow or underflow can be ignored in this multiplication.

**a) Shift x to the left by 1 bit, then add the initial value of x to it.**

**b) Shift x to the left by 2 bits, then add the initial value of x to it.**

**c) Shift x to the right arithmetically by 1 bit, then subtract the initial value of x from it.**

**d) Shift x to the right arithmetically by 2 bits, then subtract the initial value of x from it.**
?
**b) Shift x to the left by 2 bits, then add the initial value of x to it.**
## **Explanation:**

To multiply an integer by 5, we can break it down as:
#### $5x=4x+x$

- Shifting **x** to the left by 2 bits gives **4x** (since left-shifting by 2 bits is equivalent to multiplying by $2^2$ which is equal to 4).
- Adding the original **x** to this gives **4x + x = 5x**.

### Overview of other options:

- **a)** Shifting **x** left by 1 bit gives **2x**, and adding **x** gives **3x**, not **5x**.
- **c)** Shifting **x** right arithmetically by 1 bit divides it by 2 (rounding towards negative), and subtracting **x** gives something unrelated to **5x**.
- **d)** Shifting **x** right arithmetically by 2 bits divides it by 4, and subtracting **x** gives something unrelated to **5x**.
