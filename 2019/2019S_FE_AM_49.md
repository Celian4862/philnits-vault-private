In the flowchart below, what is the minimum number of test cases that satisfies the decision condition coverage (branch coverage)?

**a) 1**

**b) 2**

**c) 3**

**d) 4**
?
**b) 2**
## **Explanation:**

To satisfy the **decision condition coverage** (also known as branch coverage), each decision point in the flowchart must evaluate to both true and false at least once.

In this case, we have two conditions:

1. **X > 1**
2. **A = 2 or B = 0**

### Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:

    - **X = 2** (True for X > 1)
    - **A = 2**, **B = 1** (True for A = 2)
    - Outcome: This test case would evaluate the first condition as True and the second condition as True.
2. **Test Case 2**:

    - **X = 0** (False for X > 1)
    - **A = 1**, **B = 0** (True for B = 0)
    - Outcome: This test case would evaluate the first condition as False and the second condition as True.

### Coverage Achieved:

- **First Test Case**: Covers the True branch for both conditions.
- **Second Test Case**: Covers the False branch for the first condition and the True branch for the second condition.

To cover all branches, we would ideally need more test cases, but to meet the minimum requirement for decision condition coverage, **2 test cases are sufficient**.
