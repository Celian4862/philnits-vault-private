The flowchart below shows the algorithm of concatenating two character strings in X and Y, with the resulting character string in Z. Which of the following is the appropriate pair of operations to insert in the blanks, A and B? Here, X and Y are character arrays of dimensions m and n, respectively, where the i-th character of each string is stored as the i-th element of the character array.

## **Explanation:**

To correctly fill in the blanks **A** and **B** in the algorithm for concatenating two character strings **X** and **Y** into a resulting character string **Z**, let's break down the operations involved.

### Given Information:

- **X** is a character array of dimension **m**.
- **Y** is a character array of dimension **n**.
- The resulting string **Z** will have a total length of **m + n**.

### Flowchart Analysis:

1. **Loop 1** iterates over the characters in **X** from **1** to **m**.

    - In this loop, we need to copy characters from **X** to **Z**. Each character from **X** should be placed in the first part of **Z**.
    - Thus, the operation should be: **A: X(k) → Z(k)** (where k varies from 1 to m).
2. **Loop 2** iterates over the characters in **Y** from **1** to **n**.

    - In this loop, we need to copy characters from **Y** to **Z** starting after the last character from **X**. Since the first **m** positions in **Z** are filled by **X**, the characters from **Y** should start from position **m + 1** in **Z**.
    - Thus, the operation should be: **B: Y(k) → Z(m + k)** (where k varies from 1 to n).

### **Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the appropriate operations to insert in the blanks **A** and **B** are:

- **A**: **X(k) → Z(k)**
- **B**: **Y(k) → Z(m + k)**

### **Final Answer:**

The correct pair of operations is:
**a)** $X(k)→Z(k)$ and $Y(k)→Z(m+k)$
**Answer: a)**
