Which of the following is an encryption algorithm for public key cryptography?

**a) AES**

**b) KCipher-2**

**c) RSA**

**d) SHA-256**
?
**c) RSA**
## **Explanation:**

**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** is a widely used public key cryptography algorithm that enables secure data transmission. It uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. RSA is commonly employed for secure communications and digital signatures.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **b) KCipher-2**: A symmetric encryption algorithm used for securing data, not a public key algorithm.
- **d) SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: A cryptographic hash function, not an encryption algorithm. It is used to generate a fixed-size hash value from input data, primarily for integrity verification.

Thus, RSA is the only option that is specifically designed for public key cryptography.
