Which of the following is a description of a directory traversal attack?

**a) An attacker enters data consisting of database command statements as the input data for a web application and forces the execution of SQL statements that are not intended by the administrator.**

**b) An attacker guides a user to a web site, where a defect in the escape processing of the HTML output by a web application is exploited, and forces the execution of a malicious script on the userâ€™s web browser.**

**c) An attacker illegally obtains the session ID for a user, who has logged into a session managed by the session ID, and accesses the server by spoofing the identity of the user.**

**d) An attacker specifies a file by using the path name and illegally views a file that is not intended for viewing by the administrator.**
?
**d) An attacker specifies a file by using the path name and illegally views a file that is not intended for viewing by the administrator.**
## **Explanation:**

A **directory traversal attack** (also known as path traversal attack) occurs when an attacker exploits insufficient security validation in a web application to gain access to files and directories stored outside the intended directory. By manipulating the file path, attackers can specify arbitrary paths, allowing them to access sensitive files that should not be accessible, such as configuration files or password files.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Describes **SQL injection**, where an attacker inputs SQL statements to manipulate a database.
- **b)** Describes **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, where an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
- **c)** Describes **Session hijacking**, where an attacker steals or predicts a valid session ID to impersonate a user.

Thus, option **d** is the closest description of a directory traversal attack.
