?
**c) A person who finds a virus that is created by a stranger stores the virus for the purpose of subsequently running it on another person’s computer.**
## **Explanation:**

According to the **Convention on Cybercrime**, various acts related to the creation, distribution, and use of computer viruses are considered criminal. Storing a virus with the intention of deploying it onto another person's computer constitutes malicious intent and falls under illegal activities related to computer viruses. This act poses a threat to the integrity of computer systems and data, making it a criminal offense.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) A person creates a new virus to develop and test antivirus software.**
    While this activity may involve creating a virus, the intent is not malicious but rather for the purpose of improving security. However, such actions can still raise ethical and legal concerns depending on jurisdiction.

- **b) A person forwards a received e-mail that is infected with a virus without being aware of the infection.**
    In this case, the individual did not act with intent or knowledge of the infection. Liability typically requires malicious intent or negligence, so this act may not be classified as a criminal offense under the Convention.

- **d) A person who receives and finds a virus offers it to an antivirus organization with a clear indication of the virus’s presence.**
    This action is generally seen as responsible behavior, as it aims to help mitigate the threat by informing security experts, and does not constitute a criminal act.


In summary, option **c** is the only scenario that involves intent to cause harm, making it a criminal act related to computer viruses according to the Convention on Cybercrime.
