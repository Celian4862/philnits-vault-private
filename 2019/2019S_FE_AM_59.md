Which of the following is an appropriate activity that is undertaken by a system auditor who audits access control?

**a) Confirmation of the management status of the access control concerning the data**

**b) Creation and storage of a management table for the access control concerning the software**

**c) Establishment of a management policy for the access control concerning the network**

**d) Implementation of the operations management for the access control concerning the hardware**
?
**a) Confirmation of the management status of the access control concerning the data**
## **Explanation:**

Auditing access control primarily involves evaluating how access to systems and data is managed, ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources. The auditorâ€™s role is to assess the effectiveness of existing access control measures and their alignment with organizational policies and compliance requirements.

**Confirmation of the management status of access control concerning data** means that the auditor verifies and evaluates how access rights and permissions are granted, monitored, and reviewed for data access. This involves checking whether:

- Access controls are properly defined and documented.
- User permissions align with their job roles.
- There are processes for regular review of access rights.
- Any changes to access rights are appropriately authorized and recorded.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b)** Creation and storage of a management table for the access control concerning the software: This activity is more of a management function than an auditing function. The auditor should evaluate such tables rather than create them.

- **c)** Establishment of a management policy for the access control concerning the network: This is typically a responsibility of management or IT security professionals rather than the auditor. The auditor reviews existing policies rather than creating them.

- **d)** Implementation of the operations management for the access control concerning the hardware: Like option **c**, this falls under the domain of management or operational roles. The auditor assesses the implementation and effectiveness of such controls instead of executing them.

In summary, option **a** is the correct activity for a system auditor auditing access control, as it focuses on verifying the effectiveness and management of access controls regarding data, which is a critical component of an auditor's responsibilities.
