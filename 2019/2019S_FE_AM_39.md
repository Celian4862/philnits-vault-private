Which of the following is an explanation of the time stamp service in information security?

**a) It is a service that authenticates biometric information, such as fingerprint, voice print, vein patterns, retina, and iris, by using the date and time when the information is registered in the authentication system.**

**b) It is a service that certifies that electronic data certainly exist on a particular date and time and that the data have not been falsified since that date and time.**

**c) It is a service that securely notifies that the date and time information is not falsified midway for setting the clock of the PCs and servers on the network.**

**d) It is a web service that securely displays the global date and time information used in the official records by using encrypted communication.**
?
**b) It is a service that certifies that electronic data certainly exist on a particular date and time and that the data have not been falsified since that date and time.**
## **Explanation:**

The **time stamp service** in information security is designed to provide proof of the existence of electronic data at a specific moment in time and to ensure that the data has not been altered since that time. This service is crucial for maintaining the integrity and authenticity of digital documents, making it vital in legal and compliance contexts.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Describes a service related to **biometric authentication**, not specifically time stamps.
- **c)** Refers to a clock synchronization service, which ensures accurate timekeeping across devices but does not provide evidence of data existence or integrity.
- **d)** Describes a web service for displaying time, but it does not pertain to the authentication or certification of data existence.

Thus, option **b** accurately captures the purpose and function of the time stamp service in information security.
