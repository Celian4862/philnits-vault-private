In a growth matrix proposed by Ansoff, which of the following is a strategy for expanding a business with an existing product in an existing market?

**a) Diversification**

**b) Market development**

**c) Market penetration**

**d) Product development**
?
**c) Market penetration**
## **Explanation:**

In the context of the developmental stages of big data utilization, **Stage 4** focuses on taking action based on insights gained from data analysis to influence future activities. Option **b** aligns with this stage because it involves estimating the impact of operational errors and proactively improving the user interface to prevent future issues. This reflects a commitment to using data-driven insights to inform decisions and enhance the user experience.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) Based on the analysis results of the big data in which the operation histories of many users are stored, the operational errors and their causes that were not anticipated by the manufacturer at first are found.**
    This option corresponds more closely to **Stage 2**, where past errors are analyzed to understand their causes, rather than taking future-oriented actions.

- **c) By using a simulation that uses big data, an increase in the failure rate of a product is estimated when an operational error supposed occurs repeatedly.**
    This option relates to **Stage 3**, as it involves predicting future failure rates based on simulated scenarios rather than developing future activities.

- **d) By using the Internet access function of a product, the operation histories of many users of the product are stored in big data, and the rate of using functions is clarified after the product is sold.**
    This option describes the collection and analysis of data about product usage but does not involve any actionable insights or improvements based on that data, making it more aligned with **Stage 1** or **Stage 2**.


In summary, option **b** is the best example of Stage 4, as it demonstrates the application of big data insights to improve user interface design and reduce operational errors in the future.
