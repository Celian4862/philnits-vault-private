?
b) A technique to collect user information, such as access trends, by embedding a small image in a web page
### Explanation

A **web beacon** is a tracking technology used to monitor user behavior on websites or in emails. It typically consists of a tiny, often invisible image (like a 1x1 pixel) embedded in a web page or email. When a user visits the page or opens the email, the web beacon is loaded from a server, allowing the website owner or marketer to gather information such as:

- Whether the page or email was viewed.
- The time it was viewed.
- The user's IP address and browser information.

This information helps in analyzing user behavior and access trends without the user being aware of the beacon.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) A potential error of an application program used for a website**:

- This refers to a bug or error in web applications, which is not related to web beacons.

**c) A virus that is downloaded from a website that deletes image files on a PC**:

- This describes a type of malware, but a **web beacon** is not a virus. It's a tool used for tracking user behavior, not for harming the user's system.

**d) An abusive method of using a malicious script that is harmful to both client PC and web server**:

- This describes **cross-site scripting (XSS)** or other malicious scripts, but a web beacon is a legitimate, though sometimes controversial, tracking technique. It does not directly harm the client PC or web server.
