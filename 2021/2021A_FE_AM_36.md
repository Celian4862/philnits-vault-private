Which of the following is installed into an in-house network or server by an intruder to enter through an access path other than the normal path?

a) Backdoor
b) Forensic
c) Strict routing
d) Thin client agent
?
a) Backdoor
### Explanation

A **backdoor** is a secret or hidden method that allows an intruder to gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or software, bypassing normal security mechanisms. It is typically installed by attackers after they have compromised a system, enabling them to re-enter at any time without needing to go through the usual authentication processes. Backdoors are often used to maintain control over the compromised system while remaining undetected.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) Forensic**:

- **Forensic** refers to the investigation and analysis of digital data, often after a security incident, to understand the attack, recover evidence, or prevent future breaches. It is not related to installing access paths for intruders.

**c) Strict routing**:

- **Strict routing** refers to a type of IP routing where the packet must follow a specific, predetermined path through the network. This is a networking term, not related to unauthorized access paths.

**d) Thin client agent**:

- A **thin client agent** is software used in thin client environments, where client devices rely on a central server to perform most of their computing tasks. This has nothing to do with unauthorized access or backdoor creation.
