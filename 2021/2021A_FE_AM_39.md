%% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

A given application only has the functions of retrieving and displaying user information from a database that stores such information. Considering information security management, which of the following is the appropriate database access right assigned to an account that the application uses when it accesses the database? The names and scopes of rights are listed below.

[The names and scopes of rights]
Reference right: Permits a record to be selected
Update right: Permits a record to be inserted, updated, and dropped
Administrator right: Permits a table to be displayed, created, altered, and dropped

a) Administrator right
b) Reference right
c) Update right
d) Update right and reference right
?
b) Reference right
### Explanation

In the question it was stated that **the application only has the functions of retrieving and displaying user information from a database.** With this in mind, the update right and administrator right are immediately out of the question since they have authority to insert, update, and even delete records. Since the reference right only has the ability to select records, it makes sense that it is the appropriate database access right assigned to an account of the application.
