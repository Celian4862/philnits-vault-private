Which of the following is an appropriate description of SSH?

a) It cannot use public key pairs, and it uses a password for authentication.
b) It helps in securely loading web site pages over HTTPS.
c) It provides a secure channel for server maintenance over a public network.
d) Its use is required in the Intranet.
?
c) It provides a secure channel for server maintenance over a public network.
### Explanation

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a cryptographic network protocol used for securely operating network services, especially for remote server maintenance and management, over an unsecured public network. It encrypts data, including authentication credentials and session data, ensuring secure communication between the client and server. SSH can use **public key pairs** or **passwords** for authentication, and it is commonly used for tasks like remote login, file transfer, and command execution on servers.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) It cannot use public key pairs, and it uses a password for authentication**:

- This is incorrect because **SSH** can use both **passwords** and **public/private key pairs** for authentication, with key-based authentication often being considered more secure.

**b) It helps in securely loading web site pages over HTTPS**:

- This describes **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)**, which uses **SSL/TLS** to secure web page loading, not **SSH**.

**d) Its use is required in the Intranet**:

- While **SSH** can be used within an **Intranet**, it is not specifically required. SSH is used for secure communication, typically over public networks, though it can be employed in any network environment where secure remote access is needed.
