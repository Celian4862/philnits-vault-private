## Explanation

![[Pasted image 20241023131333.png]]

From the ASCII table, we can simply map the characters to their corresponding letters using keyEven and keyOdd like so:

0 - n + 3 = q
1 - o + 2 = q
2 - n + 3 = q

and continue for the rest of the letters, giving us the answers for A and B.

For C, this choice was chosen as it is using the modulo operator on a number is often the method of determining whether it is odd or even.

For D and E, these are the operations to determine what is the value of the character after the cipher.
