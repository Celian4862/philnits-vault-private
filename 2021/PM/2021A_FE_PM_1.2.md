c) hide the signatory of the private key from unintended parties
d) increase the encryption strength
e) significantly reduce the time required to sign the message
?
C,A
## Explanation

### For **E**:

- The context mentions **encrypting the message first and then signing it later**.

- When a message is **encrypted first**, the content of the message is hidden, including any information about the sender. After the message is encrypted, only the recipient with the private key can decrypt it. Once decrypted, the recipient can verify the signature to know who signed it.

    By encrypting first, the **identity of the signer is hidden** because the signature (which could contain information about the sender) is applied after encryption and only revealed after decryption. This fits with option **(c) "hide the signatory of the private key from unintended parties"** because the encryption ensures that no unintended party can see the signature or the signer's identity.

### For **F**:

- The context refers to **signing the original message first**, which means applying the signature before encrypting the message.

- When you **sign a message first**, the signature is applied to the original content before encryption. This allows anyone who decrypts the message to immediately verify whether the message is authentic by checking the signature.

    The main advantage of this is that the recipient can **quickly verify the authenticity of the message** right after decrypting it. If the signature doesnâ€™t match, they can discard the message without further processing. This aligns with option **(a) "detect and discard unauthenticated message earlier"**, as signing first enables the recipient to discard unauthenticated messages as soon as they decrypt them.
