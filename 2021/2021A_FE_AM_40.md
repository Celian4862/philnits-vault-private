A cybersecurity incident response plan is defined as a set of instructions to aid the cybersecurity team to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. The cybersecurity incident response plan resolves issues, such as cybercrime, data loss, and service outages that threaten daily work. Which of the following is part of the cybersecurity incident response plan?

a) Attacking systems with scripts
b) Containment
c) Social engineering activities
d) Stealing user credentials
?
b) Containment
### Explanation

The answer here should be obvious since all of the choices are malicious hacker activities that a cybersecurity team would not carry out with the exception of b.) containment.

**Containment** is a key step in a cybersecurity incident response plan. It involves taking immediate action to limit the spread or damage caused by a security breach or cyberattack. This step focuses on isolating affected systems or networks, preventing the incident from escalating further, and minimizing its impact. Containment is crucial for reducing the risk to critical assets and ensuring that the organization can begin the process of recovery.

According to [Containment - CyberHoot Cyber Library](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/containment/), examples of containing a cyber security incident include: Blocking and logging of unauthorized access, blocking [malware](http://www.cyberhoot.com/cybrary/malware) sources, closing specific ports and servers, changing administrator passwords, relocating website home pages, and isolating systems or networks.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Attacking systems with scripts**:

- This refers to offensive actions, often used by hackers or in penetration testing, but it is not part of a legitimate incident response plan. The purpose of a response plan is to defend, not attack.

**c) Social engineering activities**:

- **Social engineering** involves manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access to systems or sensitive data. This is an attack technique and would not be part of a response plan meant to defend against such attacks.

**d) Stealing user credentials**:

- Stealing user credentials is a malicious activity carried out by attackers. It would never be part of a cybersecurity incident response plan, as the plan is designed to mitigate and respond to threats, not cause them.
