Which of the following is a role of a PKI certification authority as a reliable third party?

a) Adding a digital signature to an e-mail body as requested by a user
b) Enabling the synchronization of time by returning an accurate time to a user’s request
c) Issuing a digital certificate that certifies the private key of a user or server
d) Issuing a digital certificate that certifies the public key of a user or server
?
d) Issuing a digital certificate that certifies the public key of a user or server

## What is PKI?

> [!info] Public Key Infrastructure
> A system of processes, technologies, and policies that allows you to encrypt and sign data. You can issue digital certificates that authenticate the identity of users, devices, or services.
> - These certificates create a secure connection for both public web pages and private systems—such as your virtual private network (VPN), internal Wi-Fi, wiki pages, and other services that support MFA.

It is a form of asymmetrical encryption where the sender & receiver both have a set of private & public encryption keys.

> [!tip] It's used in SSL Certificates to ensure the website you are visiting is actually from the web server & is not being intercepted.
> - that's why when a website is HTTP and not HTTPS, it will warn you saying there are is no certificate.

## Why d) and not c)?

When we do asymmetrical encryption, the client & server only sends public keys during the flow because their private key should only be used on their local machine.

That is why
- `d) Issuing a digital certificate that certifies the public key of a user or server` is correct
- and `c) Issuing a digital certificate that certifies the private key of a user or server ` is wrong.
