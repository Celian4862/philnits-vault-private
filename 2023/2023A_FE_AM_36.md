### Asymmetric Algorithms

> [!info] Each party has their own key to decrypt data after receiving data encrypted by their public key.
> 1. the **sender asks for the public key of the receiver** so that they can use it to encrypt the payload.
> 2. the **receiver decodes it using their private key**.
