## What is a System Audit Team?

A **system audit team** typically consists of **diverse professionals** with varying skills and expertise to provide comprehensive audit coverage. The composition can vary depending on the scope of the audit and the complexity of the system being audited.

### **Additional Considerations**:

- **External Auditors**
	- Sometimes, an **external audit team** may be involved, especially for high-stakes audits where independent validation is required, or when an organization wants to ensure transparency and objectivity.
- **Internal vs. External Audits**
	- While **internal auditors** are part of the organization and may have more familiarity with its systems, **external auditors** are typically more independent, ensuring that audits are free from internal biases.

## Choices
### **a) For an audit of the development progress in an information systems department, the audit team consists of members of the information systems department who are familiar with the details of the development.**

- **Incorrect**. A system audit typically involves **independent auditors** who are not involved in the development process to avoid any biases or conflicts of interest. If the audit team includes members from the department being audited, it could compromise the objectivity and impartiality of the audit. Auditors should have a degree of **independence** to provide an objective assessment.

### **b) In order to enable the person requesting the audit to issue improvement instructions on the basis of the audit report, the system audit team reports the audit results to the person requesting the audit.**

- **Correct**. This is an appropriate description of a system audit team's responsibility. The **audit team** usually reports the **audit results** to the **person or department** that requested the audit (often management or an oversight body). Based on the findings, recommendations for improvements or corrective actions may be issued. The audit team’s role is to provide an unbiased report of the findings and not necessarily to dictate the next steps.

### **c) When an audit of the information system is performed as a part of the business operations audit, the audit team is formed by the members of the user’s department.**

- **Incorrect**. Similar to option (a), **audit independence** is crucial for objectivity. Forming an audit team from within the user’s department would introduce **bias** or a conflict of interest, and the audit would not be objective or impartial. Auditors should come from outside the department to ensure that they can give an unbiased evaluation of the systems.

### **d) When the system audit team accepts the help of an expert, the decisions concerning the range of support, methods, and audit results is the responsibility of the expert.**

- **Incorrect**. While an expert may assist in a system audit (e.g., in areas like security, databases, or software development), **the audit team retains responsibility** for the audit process and the final conclusions. The expert can provide guidance or technical insights, but the **audit team** makes the ultimate decisions regarding the audit scope, methods, and results. The audit team remains responsible for ensuring the audit’s integrity and thoroughness.
