When information, such as an e-mail or a document file, is sent and received with a digital signature via the Internet, which of the following is an appropriate combination of security properties that ensure that such information is from the signer and has not been altered or tampered with during transmission?

a) Atomicity and consistency
b) Authenticity and integrity
c) Availability and confidentiality
d) Durability and isolation
?
b) Authenticity and integrity

## Why the Answer is: Authenticity and Integrity

Authenticity
- the property of something being "original" or from the primary source

Integrity
- the property of data being consistent or being free from data corruption

In our question we want the file or email to be *"from the signer and has not been altered or tampered with during transmission"* which fits our word descriptions.

## Meaning of All Words

### a) **Atomicity and Consistency**

- **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is either fully completed or not at all, while **Consistency** ensures that a transaction brings the system from one valid state to another.

### b) **Authenticity and Integrity**

- **Authenticity** ensures that the information is truly from the claimed sender, and **Integrity** ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission.

### c) **Availability and Confidentiality**

- **Availability** ensures that information and resources are accessible when needed, while **Confidentiality** ensures that data is only accessible to authorized individuals.

### d) **Durability and Isolation**

- **Durability** ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent, and **Isolation** ensures that transactions are processed independently without interference.
