## What is a Keylogger?

Just from the name, you can understand what it means:
- key: like keyboard key or button
- logger: something that saves logs or history of something

Therefore a keylogger is something that tracks the history or sequence of the keys you press and streams or saves it to some external malicious third-party.

It is a form of spyware because it spies on what you're doing.
