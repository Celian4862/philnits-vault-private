# 2023A_FE_AM_9 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

In the table below, there are five items A through E. Each item cannot be divided into smaller pieces. When a knapsack with a maximum volume of 7 units is used for carrying the items, which of the following is a set of items to be packed in the knapsack so that the total price can be maximized?

| Item | Volume | Price |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| A    | 3      | 4     |
| B    | 2      | 3     |
| C    | 3      | 5     |
| D    | 1      | 2     |
| E    | 5      | 9     |

a) A, B, D
b) A, C, D
c) B, E
d) D, E
?
c) B, E
### Step 1: Find the Price Sum of All The Choices

a) $A, B, D = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9$
b) $A,C,D = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11$
c) $B,E = 3 + 9 = 12$
d) $D,E = 2 + 9 = 11$

### Step 2: Pick the Choice with the Least Items & Highest Sum

As we can see from our calculations, c) has the highest price (12) while also fulfilling the constraints.

Hence, c) is our answer.
