Which of the following is a method for embedding a malicious java script code in the content sent to a victim’s web browser from a vulnerable website?

a) Cross-site request forgery
b) Cross-site scripting
c) OGNL injection
d) SQL injection
?
b) Cross-site scripting

## What is Cross-site Scripting?

> [!info] Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.

One modern example is when you insert user content via `document.getElementById("postContainer").innerHTML = userContent` and when the `userContent` has malicious JavaScript, it will be executed by the browser when it parses the HTML document.

This allows the hacker to then access your cookies & local browser data and send it via HTTP request by calling `fetch()` inside their malicious code.

## Other Answers

### a) **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

- **Description**: CSRF is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into unknowingly submitting a request to a web application in which the user is authenticated. The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent, such as transferring funds or changing account settings.

- **Scenario**:

    - Imagine you are logged into your online banking account. An attacker sends you an email with a link that appears harmless, but it triggers a hidden request to your bank’s server. Since you're still logged in, the bank processes the attacker's request as if it came from you, allowing unauthorized actions such as transferring money to the attacker’s account.

### c) **OGNL Injection (Object-Graph Navigation Language Injection)**

- **Description**: OGNL Injection occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in applications using **OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language)** expressions in Java-based web frameworks (like Apache Struts). An attacker can inject OGNL expressions into an application, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or manipulate server-side data.

- **Scenario**:

    - A vulnerable Java-based web application processes user input using OGNL expressions without proper sanitization. An attacker submits specially crafted input that injects an OGNL expression, allowing them to execute commands on the server, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over the system.

### d) **SQL Injection (SQLi)**

- **Description**: SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into a web application's database queries. This can allow attackers to bypass authentication, access or modify database records, or even delete the entire database.

- **Scenario**:

    - A login form accepts a username and password but doesn't properly sanitize the inputs. The attacker enters a specially crafted input like `' OR 1=1;--`, which modifies the query to always return true. As a result, the attacker bypasses authentication and gains access to the system without valid credentials.
