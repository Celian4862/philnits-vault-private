Companies usually provide a means for their mobile workforce to access the corporate network securely over the Internet through insecure channels such as open wireless networks in hotels or coffee shops. Which of the following is the appropriate technology that can be used for this purpose?

a) DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)
b) SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
c) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
d) VPN (Virtual Private Network)
?
d) VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## VPN Use Case

> [!info] A secure virtual Network that operates on top of the public internet.
> - the security of a VPN is based on the encryption of the packet between the endpoints of the VPN.
> 	- in our scenario, the endpoint would be the company servers meaning the routers in the middle of the communication cannot read the encrypted packets.
> - it uses asymmetrical encryption to encrypt their packets, so only the target server & the client can read the packets.

### a) **DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone)**:

- A **network area** that separates an internal local network from untrusted external networks, typically the internet, to enhance security by isolating external-facing services.

### b) **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**:

- A protocol used for **monitoring and managing network devices** like routers, switches, and servers, allowing administrators to collect device data and configure network settings.

### c) **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**:

- A technology that enables **voice communication over the internet** rather than traditional phone lines, allowing calls to be made via broadband connections.

### d) **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:

- A service that creates a **secure, encrypted connection** over a public network, allowing users to safely access private networks and protect their online privacy.
