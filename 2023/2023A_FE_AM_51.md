To solve this, we need to calculate the number of **one-on-one meetings** that occur when there are **10 members** and then compare that to the number of meetings when there are **12 members** (after adding two members).

### Step 1: Calculate the number of meetings with 10 members

The number of **one-on-one meetings** between 10 members is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 members from a group of 10 (which is the number of one-on-one meetings) is given by the combination formula:

$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$

Where \(n\) is the number of members.

For 10 members, we can calculate the number of meetings as:

$\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10 \times (10 - 1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = 45$

So, with 10 members, there are **45 one-on-one meetings**.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of meetings with 12 members

Now, if 2 more members are added, making it 12 members, we calculate the number of meetings again using the same combination formula:

$\binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times (12 - 1)}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66$

So, with 12 members, there are **66 one-on-one meetings**.

### Step 3: Calculate the additional meetings

The additional meetings are the difference between the number of meetings with 12 members and the number of meetings with 10 members:

$\text{Additional meetings} = 66 - 45 = 21$

### Final Answer:
There will be **21 additional meetings** if two members are added to the team.
