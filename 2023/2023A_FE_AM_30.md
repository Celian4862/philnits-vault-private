Which of the following is the most appropriate information for a router to determine the destination of an incoming packet?

a) Destination IP address
b) Destination MAC address
c) Source IP address
d) Source MAC address
?
a) Destination IP address

## Justification

We need to determine the destination, so choices c) and d) for "Source" metadata is redundant, leaving us with choices a) and b).

We need to remember that routers mainly operate in the Network Layer (Layer 3) while switches operate in the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
- Network Layer uses packets & IP Addresses
- Data Link Layer uses frames & MAC Addresses

Therefore, since Routers are interested in IP Addresses, the answer is a) Destination IP address to determine the destination of an incoming packet.
