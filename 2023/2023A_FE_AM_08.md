## Understanding a Binary Search Tree

Rules:

- A parent can only have 2 child nodes.
- For every parent node, all the children to its left are lesser than the parent's value.
- Meanwhile, all the children to the parents' right are greater than than the parent's value.
- To search for an element, we check if the value to search is greater or less than the current node
	- if it's lesser, we traverse down the tree to the left
	- otherwise, we traverse to the righ
