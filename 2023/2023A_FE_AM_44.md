Which of the following is a key that the SSL/TLS certificate of a website contains?
a) The encrypted private-key of the website
b) The encrypted public-key of the website
c) The unencrypted private-key of the website
d) The unencrypted public-key of the website
?
d) The unencrypted public-key of the website
### Why is the answer **d)** correct?

- **SSL/TLS Certificates** contain the **public key** of the website, which is used to establish a secure connection between the client (e.g., a user's browser) and the server (the website).
- The **public key** is included in the certificate and is **unencrypted** because it needs to be accessible to anyone who connects to the website to facilitate secure communication.
- During the **SSL/TLS handshake**, the public key is used by the client to encrypt a symmetric session key, which is then sent to the server.
- The server uses its private key (which is kept secret and not part of the certificate) to decrypt this session key, allowing secure encrypted communication.


### Why the other options are incorrect:

- **a) The encrypted private-key of the website**: The private key is never included in the certificate. The private key is kept secret on the server and never shared or transmitted.

- **b) The encrypted public-key of the website**: Public keys are not encrypted in the certificate because they are meant to be publicly accessible for establishing a secure connection.

- **c) The unencrypted private-key of the website**: The private key is never shared in the SSL/TLS certificate and is kept securely on the server. It is never transmitted over the network or made public.
