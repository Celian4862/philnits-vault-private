A factory manufactures the same products in two production lines A and B, where 60% of the products are manufactured in A, and the remaining in B. Defective rates of the products manufactured in A and B are 2% and 1%, respectively. When a product was randomly chosen for inspection, it was found to be defective. What is the percent probability that the product was manufactured in A?

a) 40
b) 50
c) 60
d) 75
?
d) 75
## Analyze the Problem

### Given

So when we get a random product, there is a $\frac{3}{5}$ chance it came from A and a $\frac{2}{5}$ chance it came from B.

Then, we also need to account for the defect rate of A and B which are $\frac{1}{50}$ and $\frac{1}{100}$, respectively.

### Asked

It's asking for the percent probability that a randomly selected defective product was from A.

### Solution

We can use Bayes' Theorem to solve this.

The formula for Bayes' Theorem is:

$P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}$

Where:

- $P(A|D)$ is the probability that the product was made in line A given that it's defective.
- $P(D|A)$ is the probability that the product is defective given that it was made in line A.
- $P(A)$ is the probability that the product was made in line A.
- $P(D)$ is the total probability that the product is defective.

Now, we calculate $P(D)$, the total probability of a defective product:

$P(D) = P(D|A) \cdot P(A) + P(D|B) \cdot P(B)$

Substitute the values:

$P(D) = (0.02 \cdot 0.60) + (0.01 \cdot 0.40) = 0.012 + 0.004 = 0.016$

Next, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

$P(A|D) = \frac{P(D|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(D)}$

Substituting the values:

$P(A|D) = \frac{0.02 \cdot 0.60}{0.016} = \frac{0.012}{0.016} = 0.75$

Thus, the probability that the defective product was made in line A is $0.75$ or 75%.
