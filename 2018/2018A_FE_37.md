Which of the following is a password attack that makes use of the possible combination of pre-computed hashes and passwords?

a) Brute force attack
b) Malware attack
c) Rainbow table attack
d) Zero-day attack
?
c) Rainbow table attack


## Mental Framework

They call it "Rainbow Table", because it is a hash table of hashes and their password translation. So if the website exposes the user's hashed password, you can easily reverse it by doing a lookup across the entire rainbow table to find the original input.

It's like caching the results of a brute force attack in a table so it can be used faster.
