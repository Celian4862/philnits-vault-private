Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning corporate security management when Software as a Service (SaaS) is used?

a) No system access management needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning
the procedure for password initialization or a password policy that satisfies complexity
requirements is required.
b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for
system logs is required.
c) No system operation needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning work
procedures at the time of a failure or backup is required.
d) No system security management needs to be performed, and neither the creation of
information security management rules nor the assignment of an administrator is
required.
?
b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for
system logs is required.

## SaaS

> [!info] Software as a Service
> The software already exists and the company is leasing the service and utilizing pre-existing infrastructure and application code to perform various functions.

b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for
system logs is required.

This is correct because we do not need to define the "application software development" nor "design of storage volume for system logs" because this is being done by the SaaS owner, and not the corporate business using the SaaS.

### What we should do when we use a SaaS?

What we do need to do is set security policies and backups if ever the SaaS fails in the future. Likewise, we should also define who will be managing the SaaS product in the company, so a) c), and d) are valid practices that we must not ignore when using a SaaS in the company.
