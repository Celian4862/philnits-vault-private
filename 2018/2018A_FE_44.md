Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning BYOD and the associated information security risk?

a) An employee takes home an information terminal provided by his or her company and
uses it privately, which causes an increase in information security risks such as
information leakage.
b) An employee uses an information terminal provided by his or her company to work
while in transit to another location such as a customer office, which causes an increase in
information security risks such as shoulder hacking.
c) An employee uses his or her own personal terminal for business purposes, which causes
an increase in information security risks such as virus infections due to inadequate
security settings.
d) An employee uses his or her own personal terminal privately during non-working time
such as breaks, which causes an increase in information security risks such as a
reduction in awareness of security.
?
c) An employee uses his or her own personal terminal for business purposes, which causes
an increase in information security risks such as virus infections due to inadequate
security settings.

### Explanation of BYOD and Why **c** is Correct

**BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** refers to the practice of employees using their own personal devices (like smartphones, laptops, or tablets) to access company systems, data, or networks for work purposes. While BYOD offers flexibility and convenience, it also introduces several **information security risks**.

### Why Option **c** is Correct:

- When employees use **personal devices** for work, those devices might not meet the same security standards as corporate devices. They may lack essential security controls like antivirus software, firewalls, encryption, or regular security updates.
- **Personal devices** are often used for a mix of personal and business purposes, which can expose them to greater risks. For instance, an employee might download untrusted apps, visit insecure websites, or connect to public Wi-Fi, increasing the chances of malware infections or security breaches.
- These personal devices may not follow corporate security policies or have access control measures, making them more vulnerable to **virus infections**, **malware**, **data leaks**, or **hacking attempts**.
- If an infected or compromised device accesses the corporate network, it can lead to a security breach, data theft, or unauthorized access to sensitive company information.

In summary, **c)** correctly highlights the risk of using personal devices for business purposes. The lack of proper security settings and oversight increases the risk of **virus infections** and other security vulnerabilities, which can compromise both the personal device and the company network.

### Why the Other Options are Incorrect:

- **a)**: While using a company-provided device for personal use could increase risks, this scenario is not about **BYOD**, since the device belongs to the company, not the employee.
- **b)**: Using a company device while traveling poses risks like **shoulder hacking** (someone physically viewing confidential information), but this scenario involves a **company device** and is not related to the specific risks of **BYOD**.
- **d)**: Using personal devices privately during breaks may not necessarily increase security risks significantly unless the employee is handling sensitive company data. However, it does not relate directly to the primary security concerns of using personal devices for business purposes (as stated in **c**).
