In a web environment, which of the following is the name of a program that runs on a web server and achieves dynamic processing?

a) Java applet
b) Java servlet
c) JavaScript
d) VBScript
?
b) Java servlet

## Choices
### a) **Java Applet**:

- **Description**: A **Java Applet** is a small application that used to run in the context of a web browser. It is written in Java and embedded into a webpage using the `<applet>` tag.
- **Context**: Applets run on the **client side** (inside the browser), not on the server. They require a Java plugin to be installed in the userâ€™s browser.
- **Current Status**: Java applets are largely obsolete and no longer supported by modern browsers due to security concerns.

### b) **Java Servlet** (Correct Answer):

- **Description**: A **Java Servlet** is a Java program that runs on the **server** side. It is used to handle requests from web clients (such as browsers), process the request, and generate a dynamic response, typically in the form of HTML, XML, JSON, etc.
- **Context**: Servlets are used in a **server environment** to handle dynamic web processing, making them an essential part of server-side Java web development frameworks like Java EE (Jakarta EE).

### c) **JavaScript**:

- **Description**: **JavaScript** is a programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs in the browser (on the **client side**).
- **Context**: JavaScript enables dynamic behavior on web pages, like form validation, animations, and DOM manipulation, but it does not run on the web server.

### d) **VBScript**:

- **Description**: **VBScript** (Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is a scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used for client-side scripting in Internet Explorer (now obsolete) and also for automation in Windows environments.
- **Context**: Similar to JavaScript, VBScript runs on the **client side** in the browser, not on the web server. It is also outdated and only supported by Internet Explorer.

### Summary:

- A **Java Servlet** runs on the **server** and processes dynamic web content, which fits the description of the correct answer.
- The other options (Java Applet, JavaScript, and VBScript) run on the **client side** and are not used for server-side dynamic processing.
