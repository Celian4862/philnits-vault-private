Which of the following is an appropriate purpose of using a hash value in digital forensics?
**a) To convert a password with a one-way function so that recovery is not possible, then store it
b) To prove the identicalness between the original and the duplicate copy of the data that can be used as evidence
c) To restore altered data to its original form so that it can be used as evidence
d) To verify whether password tapping occurred or not**
?
**b) To prove the identicalness between the original and the duplicate copy of the data that can be used as evidence**
### Elimination
Because the question asks about the use of hashing in digital forensics, we can deduce that most hashes are extremely difficult to decode, which cancels out c) and d), as they involve some sort of decoding that is in most cases, not viable.
Because forensics deals with investigation and not storage, a) can also be ruled out as there is usually no reason for investigators to store a password’s hash, especially if it’s not recoverable, and thus unusable in investigation.
This leaves us with b) through elimination.
### Explanation
Under the Acquisition section of the **Standards and best practices for digital forensics** in UNODC:
"To determine whether the duplicate is an exact copy of the original a _hash value_ is calculated using mathematical computations; here, a cryptographic hash function is used to produce a hash value. If the hash values for the original and copy match, then the contents of the duplicate are the exact same as the original."
