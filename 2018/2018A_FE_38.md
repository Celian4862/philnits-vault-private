## Spoofing

Spoofing is a cyber crime that involves tricking someone into giving away personal information. It can be used for fraudulent activity or to sell the information illegally. Spoofing can also be used legitimately, such as to display a business's toll-free number.

## Choices

### a) An attack by encrypting victim’s data and demanding ransom

This is Ransomware.

### b) An attack by looking at someone’s keyboard while the victim entering a password

This is Shoulder Surfing because you're right beside the person, typically with view over their shoulder, while they type their credentials.

### c) An attack by masquerading as someone such as a superior person from an information systems department, or customer

Keyword here is "masquerading", so you're pretending to be someone, like what Spoofing is.

### d) An attack by sending excessive requests from multiple computers in an attempt to overload the victim’s computer

This is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack.
