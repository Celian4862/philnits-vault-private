c) A program that is installed on a PC against the user’s intention and collects information
such as the user’s personal information and access history

order to find a vulnerable port that can be a point of intrusion to the server
?

## Mental Framework

Spyware is like observability (logging) or monitoring practices (to ensure a server is working), but instead, it's from a third-party on your computer. So they are watching what you are doing.
