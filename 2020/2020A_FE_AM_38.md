Which of the following is an appropriate explanation of an SQL injection attack?

a) It is an attack in which a command for performing a malicious query or operation is entered in the website where there is a vulnerability in a web application to acquire or falsify data without authorization.
b) It is an attack in which a commercial DBMS vulnerability is exploited to search the host database server and cause repeated infections in order to cause a sudden rise in Internet traffic.
c) It is an attack in which a malicious script is executed on the visitor’s web browser by sending the malicious code to the website displaying the visitor’s input data.
d) It is an attack in which a website visitor is made to view a web page containing an embedded malicious script, and the visitor is then made to perform an unintentional operation on another website.
?
a) It is an attack in which a command for performing a malicious query or operation is entered in the website where there is a vulnerability in a web application to acquire or falsify data without authorization.

## **Explanation:**

SQL injection exploits vulnerabilities in a web application's input fields, which allows attackers to execute SQL commands to manipulate the database.

### Example Scenario

Consider a website that uses the following query to log in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = 'password123';
```

Typically you would need to know the password and the username in order to bypass the authentication check. However, since usernames are easier to be guessed than passwords, the attacker can instead inject a malicious input into the username field:
```bash
john' OR '1'='1
```

Transforming the original query into:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'password123';
```

### Breakdown of the Conditions

**First Condition (`username = 'john'`)**
- If "john" exists in the database, this condition evaluates to **true**.

**Second Condition (`'1'='1' AND password = 'password123'`)**
- Here, `'1'='1'` is always **true**.
- However, for this part of the condition to be **true**, the password also needs to be correct, which is not typically known to the attacker.

Since the query uses an **OR** condition, only one part of the overall condition needs to be true for the query to return results. This means the attacker only needs to know the username of a user, making it easier to gain access to unauthorized accounts.
