Which of the following is a purpose of using a port scanner during an inspection of a web server?

a) Detecting the vulnerability of contents by logging in with a valid user ID and directly checking the contents of the web server
b) Detecting unauthorized use by analyzing the access history of the web server
c) Ensuring that no unnecessary service is operating by enumerating services on the web server
d) Ensuring that there is no deviation from the information-security policy by checking the management status of the web-server user IDs with the operator
?
c) Ensuring that no unnecessary service is operating by enumerating services on the web server

## **Explanation:**

A **port scanner** is a tool used to scan and identify open ports on a server. Each port corresponds to a specific service running on the server (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH). By scanning the ports, you can determine which services are active, which is very useful in checking if there are unnecessary services that are running.,.
### Other Options

**a)** is about checking the contents of the web server by logging in.

**b)** is about analyzing access history, not scanning ports.

**d)** is about checking user ID management, which is not something a port scanner does.
