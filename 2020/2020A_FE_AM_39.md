Which of the following is an appropriate use of a private key for a digital signature?

a.) The recipient can use the private key to restore an encrypted message to its original status.
b) The sender can use the private key to create a signature and attach it to a message, and the recipient can confirm the sender.
c) The sender can use the private key to encrypt a message with an attached fixed string, and the recipient can identify sections that are falsified.
d) The sender can use the private key to encrypt a message, and the content of the message cannot be understood by unrelated parties.
?
b) The sender can use the private key to create a signature and attach it to a message, and the recipient can confirm the sender.

## **Explanation:**

b) A **private key** in the context of a digital signature is used by the sender to **create** the signature, which ensures the authenticity of the message. The recipient can then verify the signature using the sender's **public key**, confirming that the message came from the sender and wasn't altered.
### Other Options

a.) is incorrect because **private keys are not used by the recipient** to decrypt a message. Private keys are typically used by the sender to sign, while **public keys** are used to verify the signature or decrypt messages.

c) is incorrect because while private keys can be used to sign data, the process described here (encrypting with a fixed string) is not how private keys function in digital signatures.

d) is incorrect because **encrypting a message** is usually done using the **recipient’s public key**, not the sender’s private key. The private key is used for signing, not encrypting messages for confidentiality.
