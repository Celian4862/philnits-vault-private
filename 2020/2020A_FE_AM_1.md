When the decimal arithmetic expression, $\frac{7}{32}$, is evaluated, which of the following represents the result in binary?
a) 0.001011
b) 0.001101
c) 0.00111
d) 0.0111
?
c) 0.00111
## Usual Method
### Step 1: Divide 7 by 32

$\frac{7}{32} = 0.21875$

### Step 2: Convert 0.21875 to binary.

$0.21875 \times 2 = 0.4375$ (integer is 0).
$0.4375 \times 2 = 0.875$ (integer is 0).
$0.875 \times 2 = 1.75$ (integer is 1).
$0.75 \times 2 = 1.5$ (integer is 1).
$0.5 \times 2 = 1.0$ (integer is 1, and we stop since the fraction is now 0).

### Step 3: Put it together from top to bottom

$0.00111$ (**final answer**)

## Shifting Method (only applicable to powers of 2)
### Step 1: Check if the denominator is a power of 2.

$32 = 2^{5}$ (32 is a power of 2, so the shifting method is applicable)
### Step 2: Write the numerator in binary.

$7 = 111$
### Step 3: Shifting the binary representation
#### How shifting works
- The shifting method is only **applicable** if the following conditions are met:
	- The *denominator* is a ***power of 2***. If the question here were was $\frac{7}{27}$, the shifting method cannot be used since 27 is not a power of 2.
	- During only ***multiplication*** and ***division*** operations. So for questions that require the addition or subtraction of decimal no. the shifting method cannot be used to convert that decimal no. to binary.
- If **multiplication**, you have to ***left-shift***. If **division**, you have to ***right-shift***.
- The amount of shifting to be done is dependent on $2^{n}$, $n$ here is $5$, so we have to shift 5 times here. In this case, we ***right-shift*** because the operation used was **division**.

$111$ (***right-shift*** **5** times) -> $00111$
- Since the decimal conversion wasn't a whole no. then we add $0.$ to obtain the final result.
$00111$ -> $0.00111$
- Therefore, the final answer is $0.00111$.
