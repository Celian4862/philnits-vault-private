A PC uses dynamic ports, specifically those in the range of **1024 and higher**, to establish network connections. Port **80** is designated for HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) traffic, which is the default port for web servers. Therefore, when a PC initiates a connection, it will use a source port number of 1024 or higher and a destination port number of 80. Conversely, the web server will have its source port set to 80 for incoming connections, while the destination port will be from the dynamic range for outgoing responses (1024 or higher).
