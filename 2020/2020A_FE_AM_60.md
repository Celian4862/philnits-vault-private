When software asset management is audited, which of the following activities is the most appropriate?

a) It is checked to see if compatibility with existing systems is evaluated at the time of installation.
b) It is checked to see if evidence, such as a software-license certificate, is properly retained.
c) It is checked to see if failures are localized via database partitioning or other methods.
d) It is checked to see if the organizational and functional structure of the software provider is considered.
?
b) It is checked to see if evidence, such as a software-license certificate, is properly retained.
## **Explanation:**

This option focuses on verifying that the organization maintains proper documentation of software licenses, which is crucial for ensuring compliance with licensing agreements and avoiding legal issues. Proper retention of software-license certificates demonstrates responsible software asset management.
### Other Operations

**a)** While compatibility checks are important during installation, this activity is more related to system implementation rather than the auditing of software asset management itself.

**c)** This option pertains to system performance and failure management, not directly to software asset management auditing.

**d)** While understanding the provider's structure can be relevant in certain contexts, it is not a primary focus during a software asset management audit.
