### What is Reverse Engineering?
You see an amazing website, and you're thinking to yourself. "Wow, how can I build this exquisite looking website?".

***Reverse Engineering***

You try to understand what technologies were used, frameworks, etc.

If you're given a complete Lego house, try to see what blocks were used, which colors were placed, and where they're placed. This should give you an idea on how it was made.

It can't be **a)** if you're wondering because we're not going to reconstruct it again.
