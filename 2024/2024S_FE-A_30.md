Which of the following is the name of an attack where manipulation is employed to place a malicious website near the top of the search results on a search engine?
a) Cross-site scripting
b) DNS cache poisoning
c) SEO poisoning
d) Social engineering
?
c) SEO poisoning
### ### Explanation

**SEO poisoning (Search Engine Optimization poisoning)** is a type of attack where malicious actors manipulate search engine algorithms to rank malicious websites highly in search results. The goal is to lure users into visiting these harmful sites by making them appear relevant or popular. Once users visit the compromised sites, they may be exposed to malware, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Cross-site scripting (XSS)**:

- **Cross-site scripting** is an attack where an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. It exploits vulnerabilities in websites but does not involve manipulating search engine rankings.

**b) DNS cache poisoning**:

- **DNS cache poisoning** is an attack that corrupts the DNS cache, causing users to be redirected to malicious sites when they try to access legitimate domains. This attack targets DNS servers, not search engine results.

**d) Social engineering**:

- **Social engineering** is the manipulation of individuals to obtain confidential information or gain unauthorized access. It typically involves human interaction, such as phishing or pretexting, and does not involve search engine manipulation.
