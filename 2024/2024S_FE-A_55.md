### Consumer Generated Media
Let's understand what Generated Media is first
These are things that are generated, like text, images, videos.

Consumers and users like us who consume data.

From that alone, you can eliminate anything non-related to that, like government policies and services.

It's not about financial statuses, performance trends, government policies, administrative services (letters a - c)

It's really just people sending to other people their own text messages, videos, images, etc.
