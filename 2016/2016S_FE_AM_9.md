a) A: No, B: No

In this flowchart, we want to get the output of not going through the Process block if $P'$ or $Q$ so it would be equivalent.

That means if $P$, it should skip the process so $A$ should be No, because Yes would lead to going through the process.

Then if $Q$, we want it to go through the process so $B$ should be No, because Yes would lead to skipping the process.
