Alice and Mary take a math exam. The probability of passing this exam for Alice and Mary is 2/3 and 3/5, respectively. What is the probability that at least one of them will pass the exam?

a) 1/5
b) 7/15
c) 3/5
d) 13/15
?
d) 13/15
### Step 1: Calculate the probabilities of failure.

$P(A') = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$
$P(M') = 1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}$

### Step 2: Calculate the probability that both fail.

$P(A' \cap M') = P(A') \cdot P(M') = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{15}$

### Step 3: Determine the probability that at least one passes.

$P(\text{at least one passes}) = 1 - P(A' \cap M') = 1 - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{13}{15}$

So the answer is:
d) 13/15
