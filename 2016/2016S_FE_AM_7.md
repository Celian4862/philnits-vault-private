# 2016S_FE_AM_7 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Let $A$ be an array of integers of size 10, whose $i^{th}$ entry is represented by $A[i]$ for $i$ = 0 to 9, and its initial value is 0. For a positive integer $k$, the rules below determine the entry in which the value $k$ is stored. When the integers 16, 43, 73, 24, and 85 are processed in this order, in which entry is the last value 85 stored? Here, $x$ mod $y$ represents the remainder after the division of $x$ by $y$.

$[Rules]$
(1) If $A[k$ mod $10]$ = 0, then store $k$ in $A[k$ mod $10]$.
(2) Otherwise, if $A[(k + 1)$ mod $10]$ = 0, then store k in $A[(k + 1)$ mod $10]$.
(3) Otherwise, if $A[(k + 4)$ mod $10]$ = 0, then store k in $A[(k + 4)$ mod $10]$.
(4) Otherwise, discard $k$.
a) $A[3]$
b) $A[5]$
c) $A[6]$
d) $A[9]$
?
d) $A[9]$
### Simplify the hash function/entry

With $k$ mod $10$, we can just look at the last digit of a number to get their initial position for mental calculation.

### Process

16 % 10 = 6 so 16 will be in $A[6]$
43 % 10 = 3 so 43 will be in $A[3]$

73 % 10 = 3, now since we have a collision because 43 is also in $A[3]$,
we proceed to Rule 2 which is storing in $A[k + 1]$ % $10$,
which is 73+1 = 74 % 10 = 4 so 73 will be stored in $A[4]$

24 % 10 = 4, since we have another collision because 73 is now in $A[4]$,
we proceed to Rule 2 again,
24 + 1 = 25 % 10 = 5, so 24 will be stored in $A[5]$

Lastly, we have
85 % 10 = 5, now since 24 is in $A[5]$, we proceed with Rule 2.

But, 16 is also in $A[k + 1]$ which is $A[6]$.

So we proceed with $A[k + 4]$ which is $A[5 + 4]$ or $A[9]$.

Then the last entry (85), is stored in $A[9]$
