# What is ISO/IEC 27000?

The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, also known as the ISMS family of standards or, more simply, ISO27K, cover a broad range of information security standards published by both the International organisation for Standardisation and International Electrotechnical Commission. ISO 27000 recommends best practices—best practices for managing information risks by implementing security controls—within the framework of an overall Information Security Management System (ISMS).
## In ISO/IEC 27000:2018 (which provides the overview of information security management systems (ISMS)), the terms **authenticity** and **reliability** are defined as follows:

- **Reliability (I)**: The property of consistent intended behavior and results.
- **Authenticity (II)**: The property that an entity is what it claims to be.
- **Availability (III):** The property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity.
- **Confidentiality (IV):** The property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
