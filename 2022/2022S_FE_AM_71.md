**b) Inventory status (inventory amount, residual orders, in-process quantity)**
## **Explanation:**

#### **Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Process:**

The MRP process ensures that materials are available for production and that products are delivered to customers on time. It works by calculating the net material requirements by taking into account the demand and the current available inventory.

A crucial step illustrated in the diagram involves calculating the **net requirements**, which is the difference between the total material required and the available inventory. To calculate the **net requirements** at step "A", the system needs to know how much inventory is already available or in process. This helps determine whether there is enough stock to meet the gross requirements or if more materials need to be ordered.

## **Checking:**

- **a) Bill of materials (configuration and requirements of each component in the final product)**
    The Bill of Materials (BOM) defines the components needed for production but is used earlier to calculate the **gross requirements**. It is not directly used to calculate **net requirements**.

- **b) Inventory status (inventory amount, residual orders, in-process quantity)**
    Correct! The inventory status tells the system how much material is available or already in process, which is crucial for calculating net requirements (i.e., determining how much additional material is needed).

- **c) Ordering policy (lot organization method, ordering method, safety stock)**
    The ordering policy affects how materials are ordered and managed but does not directly provide information for calculating net requirements.

- **d) Standard schedule (completion period, number of days of lead time)**
    The standard schedule is related to production timing and lead time but is not used directly to calculate net material requirements.

The correct answer is **b) Inventory status (inventory amount, residual orders, in-process quantity)** as this information is necessary to calculate the net requirements by comparing available inventory against the gross requirements.
