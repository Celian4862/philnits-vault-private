When a biometric authentication system is introduced, which of the following is the most appropriate point to be taken into account?

**a) Adjusting the device by considering both the probability of incorrectly rejecting an authorized user and that of incorrectly accepting an unauthorized user**

**b) Preventing the decrease in the probability of incorrectly rejecting an authorized user by using a product that frequently updates the malware definition file**

**c) Requesting an entrusted third party to issue a digital certificate for the person to be authenticated**

**d) Setting the appropriate amount of knowledge for authentication to balance the amounts of knowledge that cannot be easily guessed and that can be memorized by a person to be authenticated**
?
**a) Adjusting the device by considering both the probability of incorrectly rejecting an authorized user and that of incorrectly accepting an unauthorized user**

## **Explanation:**

In biometric authentication systems, there are two critical performance metrics to consider:

- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):** The probability that an authorized user is incorrectly rejected by the system.
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR):** The probability that an unauthorized user is incorrectly accepted by the system.

When implementing a biometric system, it's essential to balance these two rates. A system that is too strict may have a high FRR, causing inconvenience to legitimate users, while a system that is too lenient may have a high FAR, compromising security. Therefore, adjusting the system to find an optimal balance between FRR and FAR is crucial for ensuring both security and usability. In conclusion, option **a)** is the right choice.

**b)** While keeping malware definitions updated is important for security, it does not directly relate to the performance metrics of a biometric system.

**c)** Involving a third party for digital certificates is more relevant to digital signature and PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) than to biometric authentication.

**d)** This option relates more to knowledge-based authentication (e.g., passwords) rather than biometrics, where the focus is on physical characteristics.
