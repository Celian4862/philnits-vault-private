When two dice are rolled, what is the probability that the sum of the dice is 5? Here, the two dice are fair and independent.

**a) $\frac{1}{18}$

**b) $\frac{1}{12}$

**c) $\frac{1}{9}$

**d) $\frac{1}{6}$
?
c) $\frac{1}{9}$**
## **Explanation:**
To find the probability that the sum of the dice is 5, we can follow these steps:
### **1. Find the total possible outcomes:**
Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:
#### $6 \cdot 6 = 36$

### **2. Find Favorable Outcomes:**
Now, let's list all the possible pairs of dice that sum to 5:
- (1, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
So, there are **4 favorable outcomes** where the sum of the two dice is 5.

### **3. Calculate the Probability:**
The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes:
#### $P(sum~of~5) = \frac{favorable~outcomes}{total~outcomes} = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}$

The probability that the sum of the two dice is $5$ is **$\frac{1}{9}$**, so the correct answer is:
c) $\frac{1}{9}$
