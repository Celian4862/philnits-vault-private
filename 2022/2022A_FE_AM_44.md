Which of the following is an explanation of WAF?

**a) It centrally stores and manages operation logs from various systems to quickly detect and analyze an event that can be a security threat.**

**b) It is a standard of encryption methods for wireless LAN, certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and supports AES encryption.**

**c) It is equipped with firewall functions and has antivirus, intrusion detection, and other functions that work together to manage multiple security functions in an integrated manner.**

**d) It monitors the accesses to a website, and when it detects a pattern that is likely from an attacker, it blocks those accesses.**
?
**d) It monitors the accesses to a website, and when it detects a pattern that is likely from an attacker, it blocks those accesses.**

## **Explanation:**

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is specifically designed to protect web applications by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It analyzes incoming requests to detect and block malicious traffic, including:

- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Other types of attacks targeting web applications

By identifying patterns that match known attack vectors, a WAF can help safeguard web applications from vulnerabilities and threats.

**a)** This description fits a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, which collects and analyzes logs for security threat detection.

**b)** This describes Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), a security protocol for wireless LANs.

**c)** This option describes a next-generation firewall (NGFW) or Unified Threat Management (UTM) device, which combines various security functions, but it is not specifically a WAF.

In summary, the correct answer is **d) It monitors the accesses to a website, and when it detects a pattern that is likely from an attacker, it blocks those accesses.**
