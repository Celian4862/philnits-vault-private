There is a network that is divided into three (3) segments, namely an external segment, a DMZ, and an internal segment, by one (1) firewall. In this network, a service for users is published on the Internet using a system comprising a web server and a database server that contains critical data. Which of the following is the most appropriate server installation method for protecting critical data from unauthorized access via the Internet? Here, the web server performs front end processing for the database server, and the firewall allows only a specific protocol for communication between the external segment and the DMZ as well as between the DMZ and the internal segment. Direct communication between the external segment and the internal segment is not allowed.
a) The web server and the database server are installed in the DMZ.
b) The web server and the database server are installed in the internal segment.
c) The web server is installed in the DMZ and the database server is installed in the internal segment.
d) The web server is installed in the external segment and the database server is installed in the DMZ.
?
c) The web server is installed in the DMZ and the database server is installed in the internal segment.

## Explanation:

The scenario described involves three network segments:

- **External Segment:** This part of the network is exposed to the Internet and is accessible by external users.
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** A buffer zone between the external network (Internet) and the internal network. It hosts public-facing services (like web servers) while adding a layer of protection for the internal network.
- **Internal Segment:** The most secure part of the network, where sensitive data (e.g., database servers) is kept.

In this setup, the **firewall** controls traffic between these segments by restricting direct communication between the **external** and **internal** segments, while allowing certain protocols between the **DMZ** and **internal** segments. This is to ensure that services exposed to the Internet (web servers) are separated from sensitive data (database servers) for security reasons.

- A): Installing both servers in the DMZ exposes the database to higher risk, as the DMZ is less secure.
- B): Both servers in the internal segment limit access to public services, violating security principles.
- **C): Correctâ€”This setup isolates the critical data in the secure internal segment while allowing users to access the web server in the DMZ.**
- D): A web server in the external segment increases exposure to attacks, while placing the database in the DMZ compromises sensitive data.
