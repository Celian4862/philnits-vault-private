There are three (3) blue balls and four (4) green balls in a box. When two balls are randomly taken out from the box, what is the probability that both are blue?

**a) $\frac{2}{49}$

**b) $\frac{1}{15}$

**c) $\frac{1}{7}$**

**d) $\frac{9}{49}$**
?
c) $\frac{1}{7}$
## **Explanation:**
To find the probability of drawing two blue balls from a box containing three blue balls and four green balls, we can use the following steps:

### **1. Determine the total number of balls**
- Number of blue balls: $3$
- Number of green balls: $4$
#### $Total~number~of~balls:~3+4=7$

### **2. Calculate the total ways to choose 2 balls from 7**
The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 7 is given by the combination formula $\binom{n}{k}$, which represents choosing $k$ items from $n$ items without regard to the order.
#### $Total~Ways=\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7~\cdot~6}{2~\cdot~1}=21$

### **3. Calculate the ways to choose 2 blue balls from 3**
Now, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 blue balls from the 3 available:
#### $Ways~to~choose~2~blue~balls=\binom{3}{2}=\frac{3~\cdot~2}{2~\cdot~1} = 3$

### **4. Calculate the probability**
The probability PPP of both balls being blue is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 blue balls) to the total outcomes (choosing any 2 balls):
#### $P(both~blue)=\frac{Ways~to~choose~2~blue~balls}{Total~Waysto~choose~2~blue~balls}=\frac{3}{21}=\frac{1}{7}$

The probability that both balls drawn are blue is $\frac{1}{7}$. Therefore, the answer is **c**.
