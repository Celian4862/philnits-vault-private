Which of the following is an appropriate description of a checkpoint during the audit of a control for reducing the risk of system trouble regarding the application of a software patch?
a) A database administrator is appointed and master data management procedures are specified.
b) Capacity planning procedures are set out
c) Hardware maintenance records are created and managed by system administrators.
d) The system’s operation status is properly checked before commencing full-time operations.
?
d) The system’s operation status is properly checked before commencing full-time operations.
## **Explanation:**

When a software patch is applied, it is crucial to implement controls that reduce the risk of system instability or failure. **Auditing** these controls ensures that the patch is applied correctly and that any risks, such as system crashes or unexpected behavior, are mitigated. One of the most important controls is the use of **checkpoints** to assess the system's readiness and stability before fully resuming operations.

#### **Key Concepts for Auditing Patches**:

1. **Control for Risk Mitigation**:
   Implementing controls during patching reduces risks like system crashes, data corruption, or vulnerabilities introduced by incorrect patch application.

2. **System Checkpoints**:
   Checkpoints are **key moments** during the patching process where the system's status is evaluated. This ensures that any problems are detected before the system is fully operational.

3. **System Operation Status Check**:
   After applying a patch, it’s essential to verify that the system is running properly before allowing full-time operations. This helps prevent unexpected failures or performance issues.

#### **Checking:**

- **a) A database administrator is appointed and master data management procedures are specified.**
   While assigning a database administrator and setting data management procedures are important tasks, they do not directly address verifying the system's operational stability after a patch.

- **b) Capacity planning procedures are set out.**
   Capacity planning is about ensuring that the system can handle expected future workloads, but it does not specifically address the system's status after a software patch.

- **c) Hardware maintenance records are created and managed by system administrators.**
   Keeping hardware maintenance records is good practice, but it’s unrelated to checking whether the software patch has been successfully applied and the system is operating smoothly.

- **d) The system’s operation status is properly checked before commencing full-time operations.**
   This is the correct answer because verifying that the system is stable and functioning as expected after the patch is crucial to avoiding issues once the system goes live.

The appropriate checkpoint during an audit of a control for reducing the risk of system trouble after applying a software patch is to **check the system’s operation status before commencing full-time operations**. This makes **d) The system’s operation status is properly checked before commencing full-time operations** the correct answer.
