Five (5) characters, A, C, K, S, and T, are input in this order. When using stacks, what is the minimum number of stacks required to rearrange the characters and output S, T, A, C, and K, in this order? Here, when a pop operation is performed for any stack, the popped character always becomes an output. Also, characters cannot be moved between stacks.

**a) 1**

**b) 2**

**c) 3**

**d) 4**
?
**c) 3**
## **Explanation:**
To determine the minimum number of stacks required to rearrange the characters A, C, K, S, and T into the output order S, T, A, C, and K using stacks, we need to analyze the properties of stacks and how they operate.
### **Stack Properties:**
1. **LIFO Structure**: Stacks operate on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
2. **Single Movement**: Once an element is in a stack, it cannot be moved to another stack. It can only be popped from its current stack.

Push A to Stack #1, C to Stack #2, K to Stack #3, S to Stack #1 then T to Stack #2.
	stack1 = [A, S]
	stack2 = [C, T]
	stack3 = [K]
Then pop in this specific order:
stack1, stack2, stack1, stack2, stack3

You should be able to print S, T, A, C, and K in this order.

Since we used a minimum of 3 stacks, the answer is **c**.
