A system is planned to be operational 22 hours per day. However, there are two (2) failures with downtimes of 0.5 hours and 1.5 hours in 100 days. Which of the following is the approximate MTBF of this system during the period in hours?

**a) 0.00091**

**b) 1.0**

**c) 2.0**

**d) 1100**
?
**d) 1100**

## **Explanation:**

To calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for the system, we can use the formula:
#### $\text{MTBF}=\frac{\text{Total Opeational Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}}$
### Given Data:

- Operational hours per day: 22 hours
- Number of days: 100 days
- Number of failures: 2
- Downtime for failures: 0.5 hours and 1.5 hours (though downtime is not needed for MTBF calculation)
### Steps:

1. **Calculate the total operational time:**
	#### $\text{Total Operational Time} = \text{Operational Hours per day}~\times~\text{Number of Days}=\frac{22~hours}{1~\cancel{day}}~\times~100~\cancel{days}=2200~hours$
2. **Calculate MTBF:**

	#### $\text{MTBF}=\frac{\text{Total Opeational Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{2200~\text{hours}}{2}=1100~hours$

### **Conclusion:**

The approximate MTBF of this system during the period is **d) 1100**.
