When a system with a database is being developed, a security requirement states that the data must be encrypted with a key before being saved to the database, and the same key is required for decryption when the data is being read. Which of the following is an appropriate algorithm that can be used to satisfy the security requirement?

**a) AES**

**b) Diffie-Hellman**

**c) RSA**

**d) SHA-256**
?
**a) AES**

## **Explanation:**

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a **symmetric encryption algorithm**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, which matches the requirement stated (using the same key for both operations).

**b) Diffie-Hellman** is a **key exchange algorithm**, used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel, but it is not used for encrypting and decrypting data directly.

**c) RSA** is an **asymmetric encryption algorithm**, which uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. This does not satisfy the requirement of using the same key for both operations.

**d) SHA-256** is a **hashing algorithm**, used to produce a fixed-length output (hash) from input data. Hashing is a one-way process, and it's not suitable for encrypting and decrypting data.
